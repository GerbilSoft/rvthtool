This copy of googletest-1.8.0 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Removed .travis.yml and appveyor.xml.

- Disabled INSTALL() rules.

- Forced static library builds.

- Disabled some options for enabling unit tests and other
  settings that aren't necessary for rom-properties.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.
