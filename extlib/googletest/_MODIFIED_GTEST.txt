    Updates the version number in CMakeLists.txt to 1.12.1 (#3919)
    
    Due to an oversight version 1.12.0 didn't update the version in
    CMakeLists.txt. A patch release will fix this issue.
    
    I've also added a note to instructions for creating a release to check
    for this issue.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Disabled INSTALL() rules.

- Forced static library builds.

- Disabled some options for enabling unit tests and other
  settings that aren't necessary for rom-properties.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Removed test suites, scripts, and Xcode projects in order to reduce
  warnings on LGTM.

- Add a workaround for std::is_trivially_copy_constructible<T> and
  std::is_trivially_destructible<T> not being implemented in gcc-4.9.
  (They were added in gcc-5.) Fixes the build on Debian 8.
